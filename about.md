My name is Shahab Bakhtiari. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Blake Richard's lab (aka LiNC Lab) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/). Before that, I was a PhD student in neuroscience Chris Pack's lab at McGill University. My main area of research is visual perception and  perceptual learning. I use artificial neural networks as a theoretical framework for understanding brains.
