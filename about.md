My name is Shahab Bakhtiari. I am a postdoctoral researcher in Blake Richard's lab (aka LiNC Lab) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/). Before that, I was a PhD student in neuroscience in Chris Pack's lab at McGill University. 

### Research

I study the neuro-computational basis of visual perception, perceptual learning, and visually guided behaviors. I use artificial neural networks as a theoretical framework for hypothesizing about brain mechanisms that underlie learning, action, and perception.
